<h2>JOHN BOURBON, PITCHER</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td class="dropcap">T<span class="caps">hey</span> tell me that Matty can pitch like a fiend,<br />
But many long years before Matty was weaned<br />
I was pitching to players, and good players, too,<br />
Mike Kelley and Rusie and all the old crew.<br />
Red Sockalexis, the Indian star,<br />
Breitenstein, Clancy, McGill and McGarr.<br />
Matty a pitcher? Well, yes, he may be,<br />
But where in the world is a pitcher like me?<br />
<br />
My name is John Bourbon, I&#8217;m old, and yet young;<br />
I cannot keep track of the victims I&#8217;ve stung.<br />
I&#8217;ve studied their weaknesses, humored their whims,<br />
Muddled their eyesight and weakened their limbs,<br />
Bloated their faces and dammed up their veins,<br />
Rusted their joints and beclouded their brains.<br />
Matty a pitcher? Well, yes, he may be,<br />
But where in the world is a pitcher like me?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br />
I have pitched to the stars of our national game,<br />
I have pitched them to ruin and pitched them to shame.<br />
They laughed when they faced me, so proud of their strength,<br />
Not knowing, poor fools, I would get them at length.<br />
I have pitched men off pinnacles scaled in long years.<br />
I have pitched those they loved into oceans of tears.<br />
Matty a pitcher? Well, yes, he may be,<br />
But where in the world is a pitcher like me?</td></tr></table>

<h2>SUNDAY BASEBALL</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td class="dropcap">T<span class="caps">he</span> East Side Slashers were playing the Terrors,<br />
Piling up hits, assists and errors;<br />
Far from their stuffy tenement homes<br />
That cluster thicker than honeycombs,<br />
They ran the bases like busy bees,<br />
Fanned by the Hudson&#8217;s cooling breeze.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hamilton-Marshall-Gray,<br />
Coming from church, chanced to pass that way.<br />
She saw the frolicking urchins there,<br />
Their shrill cries splitting the Sabbath air.<br />
&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;this must stop!&#8221;<br />
Then promptly proceeded to call a cop;<br />
And the cop swooped down on the luckless boys,<br />
Stopping their frivolous Sunday joys.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hamilton-Marshall-Gray<br />
Spoke to her coachman and drove away<br />
Through beautiful parks, o&#8217;er shady roads,<br />
Past splashing fountains and rich abodes.<br />
Reaching her home, she was heard to say<br />
&#8220;How awful to break the Sabbath day!&#8221;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><br />
The Slashers and Terrors, side by side,<br />
Started their stifling subway ride<br />
Down through the city, ever down<br />
To the warping walls of Tenement Town.<br />
Reaching their homes, the troublesome tots<br />
Crept away to their shabby cots<br />
And dreamed of the grass and the droning bees,<br />
The pure, cool air and the waving trees,<br />
And how they had played their baseball game<br />
Till the Beautiful Christian Lady came.</td></tr></table>

For you&#8217;ve shown the speed the managers need<br />
And the lightning brain (the managers&#8217; creed),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the heart that will bid you stay.</span><br />
<br />
But when you go to the Big League, boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And play on the Big League grounds,</span><br />
As the seasons roll you will pay the toll<br />
From your fresh young nerves and your clean young soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till your pulse less buoyantly bounds.</span><br />
<br />
And you&#8217;ll learn strange things in the Big League, boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cream of the good and bad;</span><br />
You will come to know, in that shifting show,<br />
The things that I learned in the long ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I, too, was a careless lad.</span><br />
<br />
For I came to play in the Big League, boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I played my string to the end.</span><br />
To eyes divine where the white lights shine<br />
I mumbled toasts over bubbling wine&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And finished minus a friend.</span><br />

You want to play in the Big League, boy?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I guess that you will, some day,</span><br />

None was stronger and none was gayer&mdash;<br />

Striving to bat like Wagner and to slide (spikes first) like Cobb.<br />
Some of the vets cried, &#8220;Bonehead!&#8221; Others remarked, &#8220;Poor zob!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Modest as Spring&#8217;s arbutus, calm as an April dawn,<br />
He asked for no advances though his ticker was in pawn;<br />
He learned the law from Jawn McGraw but never called him &#8220;Jawn.&#8221;<br />
<br />
He graced the bench until July, leading the simple life&mdash;<br />
He wouldn&#8217;t touch a cocktail once to please a schoolmate&#8217;s wife;<br />
The slightest hint of a &#8220;creme de mint&#8221; would cut him like a knife.<br />
<br />
The village smith that stood beneath the spreading chestnut tree<br />
Had nothing on this youngster in the dodging of a spree.<br />
Others could tipple if they would&mdash;not for Recruit McGee.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><br />
Thus did the minor leaguer seek for affluence and fame&mdash;<br />
Virtue&#8217;s its own reward at times, but oft it pulls up lame.<br />
Now he has went back to the place from which he once had came!</td></tr></table>

McGill is a terrible lobbygow,<br />

The score was one to nothing, with one inning left to play.<br />
Casey, who played in centre field, had shown an hour too late&mdash;<br />
He hadn&#8217;t any alibi when staggering through the gate.<br />
So when he tore his necktie off and stepped upon his hat<br />
The manager looked grim and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s Casey on a bat.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Boston manager, &#8220;with joy I ought to scream&mdash;<br />
Here&#8217;s Casey with a dandy load, the best man on the team.<br />
He told me he was sober, but he couldn&#8217;t quite get by<br />
When he stepped upon his derby and was yanking off his tie.<br />
Of all the hard luck in the world! The mean, ungrateful rat!<br />
A blooming championship at stake and Casey on a bat.&#8221;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br />
Two Boston batters in the ninth were speedily retired,<br />
&#8220;Here, Casey!&#8221; cried the manager, speaking as one inspired,<br />
&#8220;Go in and bat for Grogan! There&#8217;s a man on second base,<br />
And if you hit the way you can we&#8217;ll win the pennant race.&#8221;<br />
This is no knock on buttermilk, or anything like that,<br />
But the winning hit was made that day by Casey on a bat.</td></tr></table>

Was making the dirt and gravel fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the shade of an old oak tree.</span><br />
His spade was long and his arm was strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the ditch that he dug was wide;</span><br />
He paused at the sound of the dinner gong&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And this is the sermon he sighed:</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Young man, you are climbing the ladder now&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your arm is as firm as steel;</span><br />
The wreath of laurel is on your brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the pride of a prince you feel.</span><br />
Do you think you will play when your hair turns gray?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I thought my prowess would last,</span><br />
But you can&#8217;t strike out the men of to-day<br />

But the strongest frame comes to shun the strife<br />

So strive to lay, while it comes your way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fence for Adversity&#8217;s blast.</span><br />

Of the ride of a modern Paul Revere.<br />
The Paul Revere of &#8220;seventy-five&#8221;<br />
Rode like a fiend and won in a drive.<br />
The Paul Revere whose praises I sing<br />
Is Arthur Raymond, the spitball king.<br />
<br />
No plunging charger, no Arab steed,<br />
Loans to Raymond its wondrous speed,<br />
No dainty thoroughbred, sleek of side,<br />
Plays a part in our Raymond&#8217;s ride.<br />
Just a lumbering wagon, creaking and shaking<br />
Serves for the wonderful ride he&#8217;s taking.<br />
And it hustles him over hollow and hill,<br />
Drawn by a good old horse named WILL.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><br />
It bumps like blazes and swerves like sin<br />
When it nears a bar or passes an inn;<br />
It jerks like the tail of a crazy kite<br />
When a brewery looms on the left or right.<br />
When it nears The Coop or The Rooters&#8217; Rest<br />
It bucks as a mustang bucks out West.<br />
But, calmly refusing to get a jag on,<br />
Raymond clings to that water wagon.<br />
<br />
<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>*<span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span>*<span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span>*<br />

To Revere&#8217;s great feat you may point with pride,<br />

Dan hit the ball an awful soak, O&#8217;Connor clenched his teeth,<br />
And after quite a fearsome sprint, the ball he got beneath.<br />
Just as he caught the pellet two detectives hove in sight;<br />
He put the ball inside his shirt and told the gang &#8220;GOOD NIGHT!&#8221;<br />
<br />
He ran to far-off Labrador, the land of ice and snow,<br />
And everywhere O&#8217;Connor went the ball was sure to go.<br />
From there he went to Canada, from there he made Bengal,<br />
Then journeyed he to Mandalay, accompanied by that ball.<br />
And then he tried Australia, seeking diamonds in the dirt,<br />
But all the time he kept that ball he&#8217;d hidden in his shirt.<br />
<br />
He didn&#8217;t like Australia, so he trekked to many a land,<br />
From Greenland&#8217;s icy mountains clear to India&#8217;s coral strand.<br />
He sweltered in strange deserts, onward, onward, day by day,<br />
But always kept that baseball hit so hard by Dan O&#8217;Shay.<br />
If you ever go to Sing Sing, which I hope you never will,<br />

He played the sun-field like a master,<br />
You never saw a fielder faster,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And oh, how he could bingle!</span><br />
<br />
Horatio Hilo played out West,<br />
Where man develops to his best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Eastern scouts all watched him;</span><br />
They trailed him through the month of June,<br />
They said, &#8220;Him for the big league soon,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And finally they cotched him.</span><br />
<br />
Horatio joined a big league team,<br />
Thus gratifying boyhood&#8217;s dream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And got the rooters rooting;</span><br />
He was the captain of the crew<br />
At spearing flies and ground balls, too;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never thought of booting.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span><br />
One night when Jack Frost whispered zero,<br />
A man named Fletcher met our hero<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And offered him a salary</span><br />
So large and thick and fat and round<br />
That it would reach from near the ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clear to the upper gallery.</span><br />
<br />
Horatio listened, felt the clutch,<br />
And subsequently got in Dutch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His former chieftain fired him.</span><br />
The chieftain watched his bowed down head,<br />
And, asked for explanation, said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Horatio tired him.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;All right!&#8221; Horatio said, &#8220;you betcher<br />
I&#8217;ll go and get some coin from Fletcher,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he was snubbed that morning.</span><br />
So, baseball players, if you&#8217;re wise,<br />

It doesn&#8217;t grip me, somehow, like the games we used to play.&#8221;<br />
The Grown-up Fan, a worn old man, began his homeward climb<br />
With memories of the Laddies&#8217; League that bars us all in time.</td></tr></table>

That&#8217;s why the Giant&#8217;s backers never have the price for dinner.<br />
His record as a manager is one long trail of blunders&mdash;<br />
He always kept the dead ones and he always canned the wonders.<br />
For three long years, with hoots and jeers, the rooters cried: &#8220;You boob!<br />
Why don&#8217;t you fire this Marquard?&#8221; But McGraw stood pat on &#8220;Rube.&#8221;<br />
<br />
McGraw has often kept young chaps when rooters shouted &#8220;Sell them!&#8221;<br />
He never tells the rooters why, and doesn&#8217;t have to tell them.<br />
He doesn&#8217;t like a lobster, and, believe me, Alexander,<br />
He wasn&#8217;t on a dead one when he kept that big left-hander.<br />
You&#8217;ve no idea how many fans called John McGraw a boob<br />
For letting other youngsters go and standing pat on &#8220;Rube.&#8221;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><br />
Rich merchants criticised McGraw in terms that were unkind&mdash;<br />
Merchants with lazy shipping clerks and men that robbed them blind.<br />
But Mac just smiled and held his peace. He should have said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t whine!<br />
Mismanage your own business, boys, and let me <i>manage</i> mine!&#8221;<br />
When Matty&#8217;s cunning goes at last&mdash;all arms in time must tire&mdash;<br />
He&#8217;ll leave a great successor in the boy Mac wouldn&#8217;t fire.</td></tr></table>

Giants count their winnings gaily, Yanks are frothing at the mouth.<br />
Glancing o&#8217;er the season&#8217;s records, looking at the layout now,<br />
Nothing seems to bring deep furrows to my pale and thoughtful brow.<br />
True, we didn&#8217;t win the pennant as we did in days of yore<br />
For the Yankees couldn&#8217;t stop &#8217;em and the Giants couldn&#8217;t score,<br />
But the New York fans must chuckle (you can get this at a glance)<br />
When they think of the Athletics and of Peerless Leader Chance.<br />
<br />
Oh, the Cubs of other seasons, how they made us writhe and curse!<br />
How they made us leave the ball yard moving slowly, a la hearse.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Oh you Sheckard, oh you Schulte, oh you great Three Fingered Brown,<br />
Oh you little shortstop Tinker, idol of Chicago town!<br />
We have followed all your doings, we have seen you going back,<br />
And to-night we&#8217;re burning incense at the shrine of Connie Mack.<br />
From the Battery to Harlem, rooters do a noisy dance<br />
When they think of the Athletics and of Peerless Leader Chance.<br />
<br />
Where Lake Michigan is seething as the seasons hasten on,<br />
Near the home of beef and bustle, near the home of Bathhouse John,<br />
Gloom has settled, fans feel nettled, nerves are right on edge like knives,<br />
Fathers spank their little children, husbands beat their trusting wives.<br />
But the rooters of Manhattan have no tales of woe to tell<br />
As they read their Sunday papers in the homes they love so well.<br />
Yes, they simply have to chuckle (you can get this at a glance)<br />
When they think of the Athletics and of Peerless Leader Chance.</td></tr></table>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
